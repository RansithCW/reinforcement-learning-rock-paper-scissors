# Rock Paper Scissors

This is the boilerplate for the Rock Paper Scissors project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/rock-paper-scissors

# NOTE from Ransith:
 PLease import numpy before running, as numpy was required for creating the q_matrix implemented for reinforcement learning.
